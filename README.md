# Welcome:

## **Description:**
This project was my first attempt at an bootstrapped online version of my CV . The site has a home page named index.html, a page for my work named projects.html and a contact me page named contact.html.

## **Installation:**
To install the page on your local machine all you would need to do is download the files 'index.html', 'project.html' and 'contact.html' to an emtpy folder. You would also need to download the 'assets' folder and all of its contents to the same folder. This is so the HTML file can draw its CSS and bootstrap content from the right place.

## **Usage**:
The site is easy to use. Open 'index.html' with any browser. If installed correclty the page should open up as follows:

index.html:

projects.html:

contact.html:
<img width="1148" alt="contact" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118240828/205860271-5e539370-ed4a-4f91-bd64-9e2d64b2ebf6.png">



The site is made up of the three pages and can scroll down to view all of the CV information. The use would only be to view the information on this page and send a contact request should you need anything from me.

## **Credits**:

The site and all of its contents were created by myself *Hayden Poulter* . You can contact me at haydenbp@protonmail.com.
